# mateu-ui

mateu-ui is an imperative UI framework.

It is based on a core project containing the base classes to define your user interface in a tech agnostic way and several ports to run your app using different technologies.

Here some features:

- it is for building bussiness applications (not for building websites. For doing that please check mateu-cms)
- it is for developers
- you only need to know basic java (not html, no javascript, no ...)
- define your screens using fluent style, plain java
- take advantage of java (inheritance, polymorphism, anonymous classes, ...) when building your ui


It aims to reach several goals:

- protect you against technologies trends
- let you focus on bussiness problems, not on ui
- hide client-server communication implementation
- limit developer freedom (yes, I know it does not sound nice, but it is very important) by forcing good practices

I hope you like it ;)
