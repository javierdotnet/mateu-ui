# mateu-ui

mateu-ui is an imperative UI framework.

It is based on a core project containing the base classes to define your user interface in a tech agnostic way and several ports to run your app using different technologies.

It aims to reach several goals:

- it is for bussiness applications (not for building websites. For doing that please check mateu-cms)
- it is for developers
- you only need to know basic java
- protect you against technologies trends
- hide client-server communication implementation

I hope you like it ;)
